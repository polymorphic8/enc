# Rust Encryption Starter Pack 

Rust is a great lang to make very simple / refined / well designed encryption apps. 


Ai made all the apps. Each zip file is its own app. Install rust on your os, and compile.  Each app has complete code in cargo.toml and main.rs. As such, it is super easy to compile on your device. Moreover, it is also super easy to feed the code to Ai and have it audit / change /update the code. It is the best of all worlds. If you want to see or use simple encryption apps made in Rust - this repo is it.

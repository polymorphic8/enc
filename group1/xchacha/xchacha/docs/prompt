can you make a production grade rust cli file encryption app? It should be the strongest and most secure encryption that you can make. It needs to be production grade and extremely reliable. It needs to be simple, for example --E or --D to encrypt or decrypt, then the input file name and output file name.  It needs a [--over inputfile] mode where it overwrites the file atomically in place- make sure it is atomic and data safe. It will always rely on a key file called p.bin in the same directory as the executable to be the key. Lastly- it will have a deterministic --keygen mode where the key file, p.bin can be made from a deterministic password. Make sure the keygen mode has a salt near the top pf main.rs, that way the salt can be changed at complile time, which will make the keygen mode extremely versatile. I am looking for the very best reliability, data safety, production grade strongest encryption app that you can make. It is meant to be good for even the most sensitive files. So please put a lot of thought into it, and make the very best app you can. Use in memory processing instead of chunk based for simplicity and reliability, as many computers have a lot of ram nowadays. ALso use chacha20-poly1305 so it is easier and more reliable than aes to make sure the app is implemented right.

<h1>XChaCha20Poly1305 File Encryption</h1>
<p>
  This application encrypts and decrypts individual files using the 
  <strong>XChaCha20-Poly1305</strong> algorithm. If a file is not encrypted, the 
  application encrypts it. If it is already encrypted (as indicated by a unique 
  "magic header"), the application decrypts it.
</p>

<h2>Key File</h2>
<p>
  The program expects a 32-byte key file named <code>2.key</code> located in the 
  same directory as the compiled binary. If the key file is missing or is not 
  exactly 32 bytes, the program will exit with an error.
</p>
<p>
  To generate a random 32-byte key (Linux/macOS example):
</p>
<pre><code>dd if=/dev/urandom of=2.key bs=32 count=1</code></pre>
<p>
  Alternatively, you can use other cryptographic tools (e.g., <code>openssl rand</code>) 
  to generate a random key.
</p>

<h2>Project Structure</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cargo.toml</strong>: Rust project configuration, including dependencies.</li>
  <li><strong>src/main.rs</strong>: Main application source code.</li>
  <li><strong>2.key</strong>: The 32-byte key file.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Building the Application</h2>
<p>
  Ensure you have <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install" target="_blank">
  Rust and Cargo installed</a>. Then in your project directory, run:
</p>
<pre><code>cargo build --release
</code></pre>
<p>
  The compiled binary will be located in <code>target/release</code>.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
  Once built, place or confirm that <code>2.key</code> is in the same directory as 
  the compiled binary. Then run the application with:
</p>
<pre><code>./xc &lt;file_path&gt;</code></pre>
<ul>
  <li>
    If <code>&lt;file_path&gt;</code> is a regular (unencrypted) file, it will be
    <strong>encrypted</strong> using XChaCha20-Poly1305, and a magic header 
    (<code>MYXCHACHA</code>) plus a 24-byte nonce will be prepended to the file.
  </li>
  <li>
    If <code>&lt;file_path&gt;</code> has the magic header, the application will 
    <strong>decrypt</strong> it, removing the header and restoring the original data.
  </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Check for Encryption:</strong> The code reads the file and checks if
    it begins with the magic header <code>MYXCHACHA</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Encrypt / Decrypt:</strong> If not encrypted, the data is encrypted 
    with a new 24-byte nonce and the XChaCha20-Poly1305 cipher using the provided
    32-byte key. If already encrypted, it attempts to decrypt with that nonce.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Atomic Write:</strong> The application uses a temporary file to write 
    the updated (encrypted or decrypted) contents, then renames it back to the 
    original file path to reduce the risk of data corruption.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Security Notice</h2>
<p>
  While this application demonstrates basic file encryption using a modern AEAD 
  algorithm, it is <em>not</em> a complete security solution. Considerations such 
  as key management, key rotation, secure deletion, and filesystem leaks (e.g., 
  file sizes, metadata) are beyond the scope of this demonstration.

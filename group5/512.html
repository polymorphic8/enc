<h1>Post-Quantum Encryption Algorithms for File Encryption</h1>

<p>
Current encryption standards like <strong>AES-256-GCM-SIV</strong> and <strong>XChaCha20-Poly1305</strong> are extremely secure by classical cryptographic standards – no practical attacks exist against their core ciphers. In fact, with 256-bit keys, they are already beyond the brute-force reach of any classical computer (the key space is astronomical). “Better security” in this context usually means <strong>planning for quantum attacks</strong>. A sufficiently powerful quantum computer running Grover’s algorithm could quadratically speed up brute-force search, effectively halving the key length strength. For example, AES-256 under quantum attack would have about the security of a 128-bit key against classical attacks. To counter this, cryptographers suggest moving to larger keys (e.g. 512-bit) for symmetric encryption to restore the original security level. Importantly, there’s no indication that AES-256 or ChaCha20 themselves have structural weaknesses – all remain “unbroken” against known cryptanalysis. In other words, any <em>post-quantum</em> advantage comes from a higher brute-force threshold, not from fixing a flaw in AES/XChaCha. In other words, <strong>doubling key sizes</strong> is the main change believed necessary for post-quantum symmetric cryptography.
</p>

<h2>Post-Quantum Encryption Algorithms (Large-Key Symmetric Ciphers)</h2>

<p>
A few symmetric encryption algorithms either natively support larger key sizes (512 bits or more) or were designed with post-quantum safety in mind. These ciphers aim to provide a higher security margin (especially against future quantum adversaries) than 256-bit key AES or ChaCha20. Below are some notable examples and their features:
</p>

<h3>Threefish-512 (Skein cipher family)</h3>
<p>
<strong>Threefish</strong> is a tweakable block cipher created for the Skein hash (a SHA-3 finalist). It supports block sizes (and keys) of 256, 512, or 1024 bits. The <strong>Threefish-512</strong> variant uses a 512-bit key with a 512-bit block, intended to offer about 256-bit security even in a post-quantum scenario. Threefish uses simple ARX operations (additions, rotations, XOR) on 64-bit words and no S-box tables, making it efficient in software and easy to implement in constant-time. In fact, Threefish-512 achieves roughly <em>6.1 CPU cycles/byte</em> in 64-bit software – comparable to ChaCha20’s performance. Security-wise, Threefish has <strong>no known practical attacks</strong> on the full 72-round cipher. Some cryptanalysis exists on reduced rounds, but nothing close to breaking it. Its design is also resistant to related-key attacks and side channels by design. Threefish is not as widely adopted as AES or ChaCha, but it is available in some crypto libraries (Crypto++ includes it) and has even been integrated into niche encryption tools. Overall, Threefish-512 is a strong candidate for file encryption when an ultra-high security margin is desired, though one must pair it with a secure mode of operation (e.g. XTS, CBC+HMAC, or an SIV construction) since Threefish itself is a low-level block cipher (not an all-in-one AEAD like AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305).
</p>

<h3>Kalyna (DSTU 7624)</h3>
<p>
<strong>Kalyna</strong> is a block cipher that became the Ukrainian national encryption standard in 2015 (DSTU 7624:2014). Uniquely, Kalyna supports block sizes of 128, 256, or 512 bits, and keys of <strong>128, 256, or 512 bits</strong> (with the key equal to or double the block size). In its largest variant (e.g. a 256-bit block with a 512-bit key), Kalyna uses 18 rounds of an AES-like substitution-permutation network. The design borrows from Rijndael (AES) but with modifications like multiple S-boxes and a larger diffusion matrix. Using a 512-bit key gives it an enormous brute-force security margin (far beyond AES-256). <strong>No practical attacks</strong> on the full Kalyna cipher are known – published cryptanalysis has only managed high-complexity attacks on reduced-round versions. That said, Kalyna has not undergone the same level of worldwide scrutiny as AES. In practice, Kalyna’s large state and reliance on S-box operations mean it can be <strong>slower</strong> than AES or ChaCha20 for software encryption. It also cannot take advantage of AES-NI hardware acceleration, and currently no mainstream CPU provides a Kalyna accelerator. Implementation support is limited but emerging: for instance, Crypto++ library includes Kalyna (including the 256-bit block/512-bit key configuration). Kalyna could be used for file encryption in modes like ECB, CBC, CTR, etc., and the DSTU 7624 standard itself defines several modes (including authenticated modes) for the cipher. However, outside of Ukraine or specialized circles, one would need to integrate a third-party library to use Kalyna – making its deployment less straightforward. In summary, Kalyna with a 512-bit key offers strong theoretical security and an official pedigree, but at a cost to performance and with much lower adoption at present.
</p>

<h3>SHACAL-2</h3>
<p>
<strong>SHACAL-2</strong> is a 256-bit block cipher derived from the SHA-256 hash’s compression function. It was a European NESSIE project selection in the early 2000s and supports keys up to <strong>512 bits</strong> in length. Essentially, SHACAL-2 runs the SHA-256 round function as a block cipher, giving it a large block and the option of very large keys. In principle, a 512-bit key in SHACAL-2 can provide an enormous security margin (it easily exceeds the post-quantum 256-bit key requirement). However, SHACAL-2 has seen <strong>little real-world use</strong>. It was more of a cryptographic experiment to “turn a hash into a cipher,” and while no fatal flaws are published, the amount of cryptanalysis on SHACAL-2 is relatively sparse. Some academic attacks reach about 42–44 rounds (out of 64) under related-key conditions, but the full cipher remains unbroken as far as known. Because it was never widely adopted, <strong>performance and implementations</strong> of SHACAL-2 are not well-optimized for end-user encryption. It’s expected to be slower than AES (essentially doing 64 hash rounds per block). Very few cryptographic libraries support SHACAL-2 today. In practice, one would likely <em>not choose SHACAL-2 for file encryption</em> unless you have a specific legacy reason – it’s mainly of historical interest as a 512-bit key cipher that had been deemed secure by NESSIE. For post-quantum purposes, more modern designs (like the ones above) are preferable.
</p>

<h3>Other Notable Mentions</h3>
<p>
Beyond the algorithms above, there have been research efforts to build post-quantum resistant symmetric ciphers. For example, <strong>Saturnin</strong> (a submission to NIST’s Lightweight Cryptography project) uses a 256-bit key <em>and</em> a 256-bit block to ensure a full 128-bit security level even against quantum attacks. Saturnin wasn’t ultimately standardized, but it exemplifies the idea of increasing block size alongside key size for long-term security. Some older ciphers also allowed larger keys – e.g. <strong>Blowfish</strong> (up to 448-bit keys) and <strong>MARS</strong> (up to 448-bit keys) – but these are legacy designs not specifically intended for the quantum era. In general, virtually any cipher with a ≥256-bit key (Twofish, Serpent, Camellia, etc.) would retain at least 128-bit strength against quantum attacks. The focus for <em>greater</em> security is on those that push beyond, to 512-bit keys or very large state sizes.
</p>

<h2>Security, Performance, and Practicality</h2>

<p>
<strong>Security:</strong> All of the ciphers discussed – AES-256, XChaCha20, Threefish, Kalyna, SHACAL-2, etc. – are considered secure against known classical attacks (none have been broken in practice). Using a 512-bit key does not magically make an algorithm “more unbreakable” if 256 bits was already unfeasible to brute force; it simply adds a safety margin. That margin mainly matters for theoretical future threats (like large quantum computers) or perhaps to frustrate multi-target attacks. For instance, Threefish-512 and Kalyna-512/256 would still require on the order of 2<sup>256</sup> operations to brute-force even <em>with</em> a quantum speedup – vastly impractical. It’s worth noting that introducing extremely large keys can complicate a cipher’s design (needing more rounds to fully diffuse all that key material), so any new algorithm must balance security and efficiency. The bottom line is that <strong>AES-256-GCM-SIV and XChaCha20-Poly1305 are already extremely secure</strong> for file encryption today; alternative post-quantum ciphers appear equally secure (with higher theoretical limits) but not <em>provably</em> more secure in real-world terms since none are actually breakable so far.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Performance:</strong> In general, AES and ChaCha20 still have the performance edge in most environments. AES-256-GCM-SIV benefits from hardware acceleration (AES-NI instructions on modern CPUs), which can encrypt data at very high speeds with low latency. XChaCha20 (ChaCha20-Poly1305) is optimized for software and performs very well across platforms (often faster than software AES and excellent on embedded devices). Post-quantum symmetric algorithms, by contrast, <strong>lack dedicated hardware support</strong>. Threefish’s design is quite efficient in software (thanks to bit-friendly ARX operations); as noted, Threefish-512 can encrypt around 6.1 cycles/byte on a 64-bit CPU, which is on par with (or even better than) AES-256 software implementations that lack AES-NI. Kalyna’s S-box approach makes it slower in pure software – one critique called it a minor security gain “at the expense of performance,” especially since it can’t leverage the ubiquitous AES-NI optimizations. SHACAL-2, being hash-based, is also relatively slow. In summary, <strong>AES-256-GCM-SIV and XChaCha20-Poly1305 remain among the fastest options for file encryption</strong> (especially when hardware acceleration is available), whereas algorithms with 512-bit keys often impose some speed overhead. That said, if you are operating in a setting without AES hardware and you prioritize side-channel safety, ciphers like Threefish (an ARX cipher) can be quite competitive and easier to implement without timing leaks.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Implementation and Adoption:</strong> Another practical consideration is how easily you can use these algorithms in real systems. AES-GCM-SIV and XChaCha20-Poly1305 are standardized AEAD schemes – many libraries (OpenSSL, libsodium, Google Tink, etc.) implement them, and they’re tested and vetted. By contrast, a post-quantum cipher might require pulling in a special library or implementing it yourself. This introduces potential risks (bugs, lack of optimization) and interoperability issues. For example, not many tools natively support decrypting a file encrypted with Kalyna or Threefish, whereas virtually every platform can handle AES. There are some libraries and products where these algorithms appear – Crypto++ provides implementations of Kalyna and Threefish, and as noted, Skein/Threefish reference code is public domain – but they are not yet integrated into common protocols. Before using a less-common cipher for file encryption, one must ensure the mode of operation and authentication (e.g. how to do an all-in-one <em>authenticated</em> encryption) is handled correctly. AES-256-GCM-SIV and XChaCha20-Poly1305 have built-in authentication and misuse resistance features, whereas if you use Threefish or Kalyna, you’ll need to pair the cipher with a secure mode (GCM-SIV-like construction, EAX, or an HMAC, etc.). This adds complexity.
</p>

<p>
In terms of <strong>current status</strong>, the industry consensus is that upgrading symmetric algorithms is <em>less urgent</em> for post-quantum readiness. Effort has focused more on replacing public-key encryption and signatures (which are outright broken by quantum algorithms) with new standards (e.g. CRYSTALS-Kyber for key exchange). Symmetric encryption will likely remain AES-based for the foreseeable future, possibly just using larger keys or tweaks if needed. In fact, NIST’s guidance notes that <strong>doubling key lengths</strong> is an effective countermeasure to quantum attacks on symmetric ciphers, so “post-quantum symmetric cryptography does not need to differ significantly” from current algorithms. That means AES-256 or a similar well-vetted cipher is expected to be safe enough (128-bit quantum security) for long-term protection of data. For those who desire an extra margin – say, <strong>512-bit keys and beyond</strong> – algorithms like Threefish or Kalyna are available and appear secure, but they are still niche. Using them in practice would require careful integration and a trust that their relatively limited cryptanalysis is sufficient. It’s a trade-off between proven reliability (AES/XChaCha) and theoretical future-proofing.
</p>

<p>
<strong>In conclusion</strong>, post-quantum file encryption can be achieved either by: (1) sticking with AES-256 or XChaCha20 but ensuring keys are managed in a quantum-safe way (since 256-bit symmetric keys are already robust even against quantum attacks), or (2) employing a newer cipher with a 512-bit key for an even higher security level. Such ciphers (Threefish-512, Kalyna, SHACAL-2, etc.) do exist and generally use 512-bit keys, but their <em>practicality</em> depends on your environment. They offer strong security on paper and some have decent performance, but they lack the broad support and assurances that decades of analysis have given AES. For most cases, AES-256-GCM-SIV or XChaCha20-Poly1305 remain the recommended choices for file encryption, providing a balanced mix of security and speed. If you have a very long-term sensitivity or specific quantum threat model, you could consider a 512-bit-key cipher – just do so with an understanding of the implementation challenges and the fact that “more bits” doesn’t automatically mean a meaningful security improvement for today’s threats.
